/// Owns the dedicated **Preferences window** for this menu-bar (`.accessory`) app.

/// We manage the window directly with AppKit instead of using SwiftUI's `Settings`
/// scene. Opening a `Settings` window reliably from an LSUIElement / `.accessory`
/// app is a long-standing pain point — it tends to open *behind* other apps or
/// never takes key focus, and the usual workaround (flipping the activation policy
/// to `.regular` and back) drags a flickering Dock icon along with it. A hand-rolled
/// `NSWindow` hosting the SwiftUI `PreferencesView`, brought front with
/// `makeKeyAndOrderFront` right after `NSApp.activate`, is the dependable pattern
/// and needs no policy juggling.
///
/// The window is rebuilt from scratch each time it's opened (we drop our reference
/// when it closes), so `PreferencesView`'s state is always re-seeded from the
/// model and can never show a stale copy on reopen.
